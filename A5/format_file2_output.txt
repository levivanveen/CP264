1 C is a generalpurpose imperative computer programming language
2 supporting structured programming lexical variable scope and recursion
3 while a static type system prevents many unintended operations
4 
5 By design C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical
6 machine instructions and therefore it has found lasting use in applications
7 that had formerly been coded in assembly language
8 including operating systems as well as various application software
9 for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems
10 
11 C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between  and  at Bell Labs
12 and used to reimplement the Unix operating system
13 It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time
14 with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing
15 computer architectures and operating systems
16 C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute ANSI
17 since  see ANSI C and subsequently by
18 the International Organization for Standardization ISO
