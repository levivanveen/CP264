There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had b**n
wandering, ind**d, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
since dinner (Mrs. R**d, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.

I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
Eliza, John, and Georgiana R**d.

The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of k**ping me at a
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
little children."

"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.

"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."

A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-rooms, I slipped in there.  It
contained bookcases: I soon po__e__ed myself of volumes, taking care
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
seats: gathering up my feet, I sat cro__-legged, like a Turk; and, having
drawn the red moreens curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
retirements.

This sentence is full of double __. Examples include:
supre__, compa__, discu__, fortre__, busine__, gro__, flo__, cla__, ble__ings, suspicious,
bo__, mo__, to__, dismi__, confe__, hoste__, po__e__, le__, cro__, gra__, addre__,

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to right hands; to left
were the clear panes of gla__, protecting, but not separating me from the
drear November days.  At intervals, while turning over leaves of my
books, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoons.  Afar, it offered a
pale blank of mist and clouds; near a scenes of wet lawn and storm-beat
shrubs, with ceasele__ rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
lamentable blasts.

I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpre__
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pa__ quite
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity,
Lindene__, or Naze, to the North Cape--

"Where the Northern Oceans, in vast whirls,
Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
Of farthest Thules; and Atlantic surges
Pours in among stormy Hebrides."
