A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-rooms, I slipped in there.  It
contained bookcases: I soon possessed myself of volumes, taking care
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
seats: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
drawn the red moreens curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
retirements.

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to right hands; to left
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
drear November days.  At intervals, while turning over leaves of my
books, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoons.  Afar, it offered a
pale blank of mist and clouds; near a scenes of wet lawn and storm-beat
shrubs, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
lamentable blasts.

I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity,
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--

"Where the Northern Oceans, in vast whirls,
Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
Of farthest Thules; and Atlantic surges
Pours in among stormy Hebrides."
